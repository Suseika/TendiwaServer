/**
 * In a 2-regular graph, applies a {@link java.util.function.BiConsumer} to all possible pairs of <i>neighbor</i>
 * vertices that form consecutive segments.
 * <p>
 * A graph is traversed in such an order that if a vertex is in consumer's {@code next} argument,
 * the next time it will be in consumer's {@code current} argument.
 * <p>
 * Starting from a particular vertex, there may be two paths that can be taken, since each vertex has exactly two
 * neighbors. It is not defined which of these paths will be taken.
 * <p>
 * For a 2-regular graph with multiple connectivity components, only one connectivity component will be traversed â€” the
 * one that contains the starting vertex.
